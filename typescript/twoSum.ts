/*
 Create a hash map stacks (or stack in TypeScript) that stores numbers as keys and their indices as values.
Iterate through nums with index i:
    Compute difference = target - nums[i].
    If difference is already in the map â†’ we found the two indices, return [i, stacks[difference]].
    Otherwise, store nums[i] with its index in the map.
Since the problem guarantees exactly one solution, we can stop when found.
