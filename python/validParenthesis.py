Immediately reject if the string has odd length or starts/ends with an invalid bracket (quick boundary check).
Use a stack:
    Push opening brackets onto the stack.
    When encountering a closing bracket:
        If the stack is empty â†’ invalid.
        Pop from the stack and ensure it matches the closing bracket using a mapping.
At the end, the stack must be empty for the string to be valid.
